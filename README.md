<h1 align="center">Milestone Project 4 - Clout Mafia</h1>

[View project here](https://clout-mafia-ms4.herokuapp.com/)

This eCommerce site is based on advertising and selling exclusive sneakers. The target market audience has a unique market for individuals who have a taste in fashion. Being able to register/login/log out as well as adding/updating/deleting items from the inventory as well as the shopping basket. Giving users the different options of sneakers and sizes as well as being able to search for them to select from depending on availability. 

As the business is a startup, products sold will still be advertised but marked sold disabling and removing the opportunity to be repurchased. The reason for this approach is to build the hype for the user client tell and to showcase what users have missed out on. 

This site would be utilizing Python and Django which was taught from the Code Institute. I will also be using various technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JQuery and Bootstrap. This project will be responsive and accessible to different size browsers and devices.

## User Experience (UX)

### The Audience

The intended audience for this project is individuals who are into casual contemporary fashion, namely exclusive designer footwear and streetwear.

### User Objectives

To be able to find and purchase a pair of sneakers easily. Navigate through the site with a consistent layout and structure making the sneakers clear to be seen and accessible. When a pair of sneakers is selected, it will direct the user to a detailed product page, which would display a larger picture of the product, a description and sneaker size.

After having some items added to the basket, to be able to preview the selected sneakers and to see the total price. Once decided to make an order, to be able to go and check out and put in all the card details to purchase the items. To also have the ability to create an account and store the previous orders associated with the account.

Having an additional option to post a testimonial about the service/website to share with other users and having it displayed on the home page to be seen by other users.

### My Objectives

To create a site that would allow a user to register and have a profile on the site. For the user to be able to search for a product and select it to find out more details about it. Either on the products page or the product detail page, the user would be able to add the product to the shopping basket. Then having the user then go to checkout and purchase their order.

The site would have a CRUD software architectural style (Create, Read, Update and Delete) for basic operations of persistent storage with the products being added by the admin user. Validation would be included in the site when it comes to adding products, user details and user card details. When a user sends an email to the site admin, to have the subject automatically post to the database for analysing.

### Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The colour scheme I will be working with is mainly black and white to keep it simple and easy on the eyes. The concept is to make the images of the sneakers be the focus of the site.

-   #### Typography
    -   I have chosen to use [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed) and [Sarabun](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun) font as the main fonts throughout the website with Sans Serif as the emergency font in the case for any reason the font is not being imported into the site correctly. Both [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed) and [Sarabun](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun) are attractive fonts to use as it easy to clear and easy to read. [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed) would be used for all the headers of the site whereas [Sarabun](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun) would be used for the rest of the content

-   #### Imagery
    -   The images that were used as based on the purpose of the site being focused on selling sneakers. All images have been taken personally as I would also be advertising sneakers that have been sold before this project. Other images for this project were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

*   ### Wireframes

    #### Home Page - [View](https://github.com/adnanmuhtadi/milestone-project-4/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/home-page.pdf)

## Testing

Testing was taken place during my build of the site. I was utilising Visual Studio Code 'Live Preview' along with GitPod using localhost to visually see what my website looks like with every change that was being made. I also used Chrome Dev Tools to assist with changes when the code was not working as planned. Within the Chrome Dev Tools, I was also using the responsive views to see the development for the responsive sizes. To test the JS, I would use Chrome Dev Tools and choosing 'Console' to make sure everything was running smoothly.

In this section, I would be testing the User Stories taken from the User Experience Section (UX), testing the functionality and usability, testing the responsive views as well as browser testing.

### Validation

On code completion, I ensured my code was validated with no syntax errors. I used [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for HTML5, [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for CSS3 to ensure my code is W3C Compliant. I used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to help detect errors and potential problems in your JavaScript code. I also used [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) to validate my python scripts

#### Results

#### HTML - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

- On most HTML files, the errors that were displayed were due to having the Django library included in it.
- Layout structure, due to the fact I was including the base files which has the doctypes.
- To resolve the errors, I stripped the base file and added the other files in between the code which effectively resolved more of the common errors, to ensure the code itself would pass the validator.


#### CSS - [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - [Results](https://github.com/adnanmuhtadi/milestone-project-4/blob/main/documentation/validation/w3c-css-validator-results.pdf)

- No corrections were required on all CSS documents.
- (Attaching one document as they were all the same)

#### JS - [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) - [Results](https://github.com/adnanmuhtadi/milestone-project-4/blob/main/documentation/validation/jshint-validator-success.png)

- Helps to detect errors and potential problems in your JavaScript code.
Everything passed apart from one warning sign which is as expected as JSHint is using an old version of ES

#### Python - [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) - [Results](https://github.com/adnanmuhtadi/milestone-project-4/blob/main/documentation/validation/pep8-example.png)

- The tests run from multiple areas, the [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) problem console and PEP8 online
- Only needing to fix the "line too long" error and the files which were created by Django when creating apps that were not used.

### Further Testing

#### User Stories Testing from User Experience (UX) Section - [View Results](https://github.com/adnanmuhtadi/milestone-project-4/blob/main/documentation/testing-md-docs/user-testing-ux.md)

When carrying out the User Story Testing, I placed myself as the user being provided instructions on how to complete the user stories. The intended type of users which this website is targeted for are individuals who have a unique appreciation for footwear. I displayed screenshots with the results of each finding to provide evidence of the stories being achieved successfully.

#### Functionality and Usability Testing - [View Results](https://github.com/adnanmuhtadi/milestone-project-4/blob/main/documentation/testing-md-docs/features-function-testing.md)

Testing all my functions and features within the site and ensuring that it is usable across different browsers and devices. I structured the results out in a table with each section defining the feature/function, a description of what I am testing as well as if it passes or fails.

#### Browser and Responsive Testing

All tests that have been mentioned in the link above was tested on the following browsers: Chrome, Edge and Firefox. All features and functions worked as expected, including the addition of UX designs (except for the known issues mentioned below). The site got tested on different size devices that consisted of a laptop 13 inches, a tablet and a mobile phone.

### Known Issues

- When the user only selects one product in the laptop screen size, visits the basket, the price summary overlaps the footer. It works fine when there are multiple items in the basket.
- When a user has no delivery details saved in the profile and then proceeds to make an order. When inputting the details of the user and UNCHECKING the 'Save Info' button, it will still save the information in their profile
- When deleting a product, it will also delete it from the order history when I user purchases it.
- In testimonials, the user can either put a -number or a number more than 5 when creating a new testimonial, however it will still be displayed as no ratings in the testimonial main page

## Deployment

### Making a Clone

I had to get the SSH key from the repository which allowed me to clone the repository to my local hard drive. 
The method which I used to clone the project was via the terminal as well as Github Desktop. I was able to connect my Github repository and clone my files through this method. 

<img src="documentation/images/making-a-clone.png">

#### Step 1 - Method 1 (Steps taken in VSCode)
1. Open your IDE and open up the Terminal
1. Inside your terminal type `git clone git@github.com:adnanmuhtadi/milestone-project-4.git`
    - This would clone what is in GitHub to your computer and so now modification to the files can happen on your local machine
1. Inside your terminal type `git status
    - To see what changes have been made
1. Type `git -a`
    - To add all the files that you have worked on to the stage
1. Type `git commit -m "add notes here"`
    - To add a message to files you are about to push to the servers
1. Type `git push`
    - To upload to the remote repository

#### Step 1 - Method 2
1. Open the repository that needs to be cloned.
1. On the top-right side of the page, above the files, you will see a button 'Code' with an arrow pointing down.
1. Once clicked, a drop-down would appear which would give me the option 'Open with GitHub Desktop' 
(as I had already pre-installed [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) previously).
1. Once clicked, it would automatically open the application and request where for it to be saved.

#### Step 2 - Create Env.py
1. Need to install the project requirements from the requirements.txt file.
    - In the terminal, type in `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. Create a new file in the dictory called 'env.py'
    - In the terminal, type in `git touch env.py`
1. Inside the env.py file you will need to add the following:
```
# Python env code to set all defaults

SECRET_KEY=(yoursecretkeyhere)
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=(yourstripepublickeyhere)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=(youryourstripesecretkeyherekeyhere)
STRIPE_WH_SECRET=(yourstripewhsecretkeyhere)
GMAPS_API=(yourgmapsapikeyhere)
```
4. Need to make the migrations to the local database
    - In the terminal, type in `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` to make sure no errors appear
    - In the terminal, type in `python3 manage.py makemigrations`,
    - In the terminal, type in `python3 manage.py migrate --plan` to make sure no errors appear
    - In the terminal, type in `python3 manage.py migrate`
5. Need to load the premade fixtures that have been created we would start by loading the categories and then the products
    - In the terminal, type in `python3 manage.py loaddata categories`
    - In the terminal, type in `python3 manage.py loaddata products`
5. To be able to access the back end of the site, you would need to create a super user
    - In the terminal, type in `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
    - Then follow my steps in the terminal
6. To preview the site, in the terminal, type in `python3 manage.py runserver`

### Acknowledgements

I want to thank my mentor Aaron Sinnott who guided me in the right direction and for his support. This project has allowed me to experience the powers of Python, Django and much more. It has enabled the developer/me to understand and appreciate the extensive strength of apps and how they all interlock. It has made me aware that doing this project, I have only scratched the surface when coding in Python.

I also want to thank the Code Institute tutorials especially the Boutique Ado project for helping me to build and achieve this project. I would like to thank Code Institute Tutors, who guided me in the right direction when I struggled in understanding the small issues I faced during the pro. The project was developed for a couple of friends who buy and sell sneakers as they wanted an online shop.
