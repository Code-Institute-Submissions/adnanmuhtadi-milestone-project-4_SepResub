This eCommerce site is based on advertising and selling exclusive sneakers. The target market audience has a unique market for individuals who have a taste in fashion. Being able to register/login/log out as well as adding/updating/deleting items from the inventory as well as the shopping basket. Giving users the different option of sneakers and sizes as well as being able to search for them to select from depending on availability.

This site would be utilizing Python and Django which was taught from the Code Institute. I will also be using various technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JQuery and Bootstrap. This project will be responsive and accessible to different size browsers and devices.

## User Experience (UX)

### The Audience

The intended audience for this project is individuals who are into casual contemporary fashion, namely exclusive designer footwear and streetwear.

### User Objectives

To be able to find and purchase a pair of sneakers easily. Navigate through the site with a consistent layout and structure making the sneakers clear to be seen and accessible. When a pair of sneakers is selected, it will direct the user to a detailed product page, which would display a larger picture of the product, a description and sneaker size.

After having some items added to the basket, to be able to preview the selected sneakers and to see the total price. Once decided to make an order, to be able to go and check out and put in all the card details to purchase the items. To also have the ability to create an account and store the previous orders associated with the account.

Having an additional option to post a testimonial about the service/website to share with other users and having it displayed on the home page to be seen by other users.

### My Objectives

To create a site that would allow a user to register and have a profile on the site. For the user to be able to search for a product and select it to find out more details about it. Within the details page for the user, to be able to select the size that they want and add it to their bag. Having the user then go to checkout and purchase their order.

The site would have a CRUD software architectural style (Create, Read, Update and Delete) for basic operations of persistent storage with the products being added by the admin user. Validation would be included in the site when it comes to adding products, user details and user card details. When a user sends an email to the site admin, to have the subject automatically post to the database for analysing.

### Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The colour scheme I will be working with is mainly black and white to keep it simple and easy on the eyes. The concept is to make the images of the sneakers be the focus of the site.

-   #### Typography
    -   I have chosen to use [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed) and [Sarabun](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun) 
font as the main fonts throughout the website with Sans Serif as the emergency font in the case for any reason the font is not being imported into the site correctly. Both [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed) and [Sarabun](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun) are attractive fonts to use as it easy to clear and easy to read. [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed) would be used for all the headers of the site where as [Sarabun](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun) would be used for the rest of the content

-   #### Imagery
    -   The images that were used as based on the purpose of the site being focused on selling sneakers. All images have been taken personally as I would also be advertising sneakers that have been sold before this project.

### Validation


On code completion, I ensured my code was validated with no snytax errors. I used [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for HTML5, [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for CSS3 to ensure my code is W3C Compliant. I used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to helps to detect errors and potential problems in your JavaScript code. I also used [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) to validate my python scripts
