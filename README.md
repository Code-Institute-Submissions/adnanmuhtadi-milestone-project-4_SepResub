Giving users the different option of sneakers and sizes as well as being able to search for them to select from depending on availability.

This site would be utilizing Python and Django which was taught from the Code Institute. I will also be using various technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JQuery and Bootstrap. This project will be responsive and accessible to different size browsers and devices.

### Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The colour scheme I will be working with is mainly black and white to keep it simple and easy on the eyes. The concept is to make the images of the sneakers be the focus of the site.

-   #### Typography
    -   I have chosen to use [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed) and [Sarabun](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun) 
font as the main fonts throughout the website with Sans Serif as the emergency font in the case for any reason the font is not being imported into the site correctly. Both [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed) and [Sarabun](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun) are attractive fonts to use as it easy to clear and easy to read. [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed) would be used for all the headers of the site where as [Sarabun](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun) would be used for the rest of the content

-   #### Imagery
    -   The images that were used as based on the purpose of the site being focused on selling sneakers. All images have been taken personally as I would also be advertising sneakers that have been sold before this project.

### Validation


On code completion, I ensured my code was validated with no snytax errors. I used [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for HTML5, [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for CSS3 to ensure my code is W3C Compliant. I used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to helps to detect errors and potential problems in your JavaScript code. I also used [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) to validate my python scripts
